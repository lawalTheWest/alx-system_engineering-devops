# Web Stack Debugging

Debugging web applications involves identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues within the various layers of the technology stack. This README provides an overview of key aspects involved in debugging a web stack, including front-end, back-end, network, infrastructure, and Docker debugging.

---

## Front-end Debugging
Troubleshooting issues related to the client-side of the application, including user interface, functionality, and performance.

---

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Use built-in developer tools in modern web browsers for inspecting HTML, CSS, debugging JavaScript, and analyzing network requests.
- **Logging**: Instrument JavaScript code with logging statements to track the flow of execution and identify errors.
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across different web browsers and devices using tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs.

---

## Back-end Debugging
Identifying and resolving issues related to server-side code, databases, and server infrastructure.

---

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging within back-end code to track request flow and identify errors.
- **Debugging Tools**: Utilize framework-specific debugging tools (e.g., Django Debug Toolbar, Rails Console) for insights into back-end behavior.
- **Database Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize database queries for better performance.

---

## Network Debugging
Understanding and troubleshooting network-related issues for smooth application operation.

---

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Network Monitoring Tools**: Capture and analyze network traffic using tools like Wireshark or Fiddler.
- **API Testing**: Thoroughly test and monitor API endpoints for integration issues.

---

## Infrastructure Debugging
Diagnosing issues related to underlying infrastructure, including servers, load balancers, and cloud services.

---

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch for tracking system metrics and setting up alerts.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define and manage infrastructure programmatically using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.

---

## Docker Debugging
Identifying and resolving issues related to Docker containers and containerized applications.

---

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Docker Logs**: Use `docker logs` command to view logs from running containers.
- **Docker Exec**: Execute commands inside a running container for debugging purposes using `docker exec`.
- **Docker Compose**: Debug multi-container applications defined with Docker Compose using `docker-compose logs` and `docker-compose exec`.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks in Docker containers to monitor container status and health.
- **Container Inspect**: Use `docker inspect` to get detailed information about Docker objects such as containers, images, networks, and volumes.

By leveraging these tools and techniques across various layers of the technology stack, developers effectively identify and resolve issues, ensuring the reliability and performance of web applications.
