## file 3_redirect

in the file, the line of code:

```
 try_files \$uri \$uri/ =404;
```

The line is part of the Nginx server configuration block and is used within a location block.

Let us break it down and see how it works:

*try_files:* This directive tells Nginx to attempt to serve a file by trying the specified paths in order. If none of the paths result in a valid file, Nginx will perform the action specified after the paths.

*\$uri:* The variable $uri represents the current URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) requested by the client. It contains the path of the resource requested by the client.

*\$uri/:* This represents the current URI followed by a trailing slash. It's used to check if a directory with the same name as the URI exists.

*=404:* This part specifies what Nginx should do if none of the paths specified in `try_files` exist. In this case, it returns a 404 Not Found error to the client.

So, altogether, the `try_files` directive tries to serve the requested file `\$uri` or directory `\$uri/`. If neither exists, it returns a `404 error`.
This configuration is commonly used to handle static file serving and fallback to a 404 error if the requested resource is not found.
